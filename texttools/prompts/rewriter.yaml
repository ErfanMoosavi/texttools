  positive: |
    You are an AI assistant designed to generate high-quality training data for semantic text embedding models.
    Your task is to create a positive pair for a given "Anchor" text.

    A high-quality positive pair consists of two sentences that are semantically equivalent or highly similar in meaning, but differ in wording, syntax, and sentence structure.
    They should be paraphrases of each other.

    Instructions:
    - Preserve Core Meaning: The generated sentence must convey the same key information, intent, and context as the Anchor.
    - Vary Lexicon: Use different words and phrases (synonyms, related terms).
    - Vary Syntax: Change the sentence structure (e.g., active to passive voice, change clause order, combine or split sentences).
    - Maintain Similar Length: The generated sentence should be of roughly the same length and level of detail as the Anchor.
    - Avoid Minor Changes: Do not just add/remove a few words or swap names. Create a fundamentally different sentence.

    Respond only in JSON format:
    {{"result": "str"}}

    Anchor Text:
    "{input}"

  negative: |
    You are an AI assistant designed to generate high-quality training data for semantic text embedding models.
    Your task is to create a negative sample for a given "Anchor" text.

    A high-quality negative sample is a sentence that is semantically unrelated to the Anchor's specific question, while staying within the same general domain (religious topics).

    Instructions:
    - Stay in Domain: The sentence must be about the text's topics, but on a different subject
    - Ensure Clear Distinction: The topic should be clearly different from the anchor's specific focus

    Good Examples for religious anchors:
    Anchor: "چه کسی به عنوان اولین نفر وارد بهشت خواهد شد؟"
    Negative: "احکام وضو در اسلام چیست؟"
    Negative: "داستان حضرت موسی در قرآن چگونه بیان شده است؟"
    Negative: "فضیلت های ماه رمضان چیست؟"

    Bad Examples (too related):
    Bad: "چه کسی بهشت را مدیریت می کند؟" 
    Bad: "ویژگی های بهشت چیست؟"
    Bad: "شرایط ورود به بهشت کدامند؟"

    Respond only in JSON format:
    {{"result": "str"}}

    Anchor Text:
    "{input}"

  hard_negative: |
      You are an AI assistant designed to generate high-quality training data for semantic text embedding models.
      Your task is to create a hard-negative sample for a given "Anchor" text.

      A high-quality hard-negative sample is a sentence that is topically related but semantically distinct from the Anchor. It should share some context (e.g., same domain, same entities) but differ in a crucial piece of information, action, conclusion, or specific detail. The goal is to create a sample that is difficult for a naive model to distinguish from a positive sample.

      Instructions:
      - Stay in General Domain: Remain in the same broad domain (e.g., religious topics), but choose a completely different subject matter.
      - Maintain Topical Overlap: Keep the same domain, subject, or entities (e.g., people, products, concepts) as the Anchor.
      - Alter a Key Semantic Element: Change one of the following:
        . Specific Detail: Change a date, number, location, or technical specification.
        . Action/Event: Describe a different action taken by the same entity.
        . Outcome/Conclusion: Present a different result or opposing viewpoint on the same topic.
        . Conditional Context: Add or remove a condition that changes the entire meaning.
      - Avoid Being a Paraphrase: The sentence must NOT be semantically equivalent. The core factual claim or intent must be different.
      - Make it Challenging: The difference should be subtle enough that it requires a deep understanding of the text to identify, not just a simple keyword mismatch.

analyze_template:

  positive: | 
    Analyze the following text to identify its core intent, key concepts, 
    and the specific information it is seeking.
    Provide a brief, summarized understanding of the text's meaning that
    will help in rephrasing it accurately without changing its intent.       
    Here is the text:
    {input}

  negative: |
    Analyze the following text to identify its exact wording, phrasing,
    and the literal meaning it conveys.
    Provide a brief, summarized analysis of its linguistic structure and current meaning,
    which will then be used to create a new text with similar words but a different meaning.      
    Here is the text:
    {input}
