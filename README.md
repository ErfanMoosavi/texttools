# what this library is NOT?

this is a set of tools for high level NLprocessing

what do i mean when i say high level? this library **will not** contain:
- an standard `regex` 
- normalization words


# What it has is:

- question_detector: detecting if an incoming text is a question or not
- categorizer: no finetuning need, categorizer
- ... (you tell me what you want)
